# BMDotfiles
These are my dotfiles. There are many like them, but these ones are mine.

## Installing

Run <kbd>make install</kbd> which will bootstrap homebrew and Oh-my-zsh! as well as setting up
symlinks for all of the files in `./dotfiles` to `~`. Subsequently, you can just run <kbd>make
update</kbd> to pull the latest version of the files and refresh the symlinks.
